# React

React is what interests me most in the JavaScript world right now, although I am somewhat holding back on my journey through it. I have decided to focus more on PHP and Laravel initially because I believe that is where the work is for me right now and the goal in all of this learning is to change careers, but I find time occasionally to work with React mainly for fun, but of course in todays market it is a very valuable skill to have.

Up to now I have been following some material on **YouTube** and **Udemy** and have managed to ship my first React project - _Robofrieds_ you can check out ther code [here](https://github.com/shan5742/robofriends) and see the app in action [here](https://trusting-fermi-4202d9.netlify.com/).

My first tech interview came off the back ofa technical assignment I did for the company, the brief for the assignment was as follows:

```
Acceptance criteria:

- application must use the API outlined in the technical specification for the data

- api key must be passed through requester headers

- the page should replicate a real page, including a standard header, footer and Leighton brand name.

- page must be responsive

- each product should be displayed separately

- a product must display the productId, name, brand, colour, description, sizes and a buy button.

- a featured product should be made prominent at the top of the page and not repeated.

- products should only be shown where stock is available

- products with stock should only show options for the sizes where stock is available

- placeholder images are used for product thumbnails

- content must be accessible

- codebase must be made available on a GIT repository


Technical specification:

- api endpoint: ****************************************

- api token key: ********

- api token value: *******************************

- api param key: TableName

- api param value: products

- featured product id: ****************


Optional/Desirable:

- MVC structure

- Unit tested

- CSS preprocessor (SASS)

- angular/typescript
```

I decided to use React to do this as a way of learning more about React and hopefully showing my potential employers that I am up to date with modern technologies even if they are not my main focus. The code from my assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/shan5742/leighton-test) and you can see a live version of the site I created [here](https://amazing-mirzakhani-486d14.netlify.com/) deployed using **Netlify**

## Todo List in React

I have built a simple Todo list in React, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/shan5742/react-todo), now in terms of styling it is super simple and I have not saved the list with local storage, so everytime the page is refreshed the list is blank, but that is fine as it is not really the point here.

I made this app to get practice dealing with and changing the state as well as some basic handlers like `onSubmit` `onClick`.

I'm now comfortable with creating components quickly and the basics of making simple one page React apps, next up I will be getting to grips with the React router, where I will create a simple mock site just to get used to navigating and using the router.
