Mixed things up a little from all the javascript.

I have been working on installing the LAMP stack on a virtual server over the past few days.

The end goal is to get Linux, Apache, PHP and Mysql installed on a virtual Droplet (via Digital Ocean) and then proceed to install WordPress.

I'm having no problems installing the stack, but it seems I am struggling with installing wordpress, which I think is due to some errors in the apache config.

Hopefully figure this out over the next few days.

This exercise has been great for getting used to moving around in the Linux system, which is never a bad thing.
