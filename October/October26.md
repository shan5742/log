# October 26th

I've been somewhat slacking since my first interview rejection, part due to being a little disheartened, part due to being a little confused in terms of direction and part due to being busy.

I hope to be more active going forward, spending the majority of my time writing code here are some of my upcoming plans:

- keep working through **eloquent JavaScript**
- Start looking at Golang (for fun)
- Wireframe and start buiding Mindfulness app
- Keep up with working on Bash scripting
- More work with DO droplets, basic linux server admin and static sites
- Start learning and working with PHP

The above is what is on my agenda for the forseeable, hopefully I can make a good dent in these throughout November.
