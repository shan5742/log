# October 1st

Been a slow week, but I have been working slowly through eloquent javascript as well as spending some time looking over other peoples code, to learn and to help some of my friends, which has been good and something I definitely need to do more.

Aside from that I'm doing some final preparation for upcoming interview.

### Dat T Shirt

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software that takes place every October. It's run by Digital Ocean (not sponsored by them, just like what they do) and the rules are simple. All you have to do to take part is sign up on their [website -](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) - and make five pull requests in the month of October, to any public repo on GitHub. And just like that, you get rewarded with a free t-shirt!

This shouldn't be too tough to complete, but getting the tee will be nice and contirbuting to open source is always a good thing, so I urge many others to do it too, hopefully I will be writing a blog on this too.
