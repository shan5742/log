Switch in focus after studying job market. PHP and laveral are in demand for jobs in my regions, so focusing on both.

- Created second droplet on DO
- SSH'd into server
- Added sudo user to server
- installed LAMP stack on virtual server
- installed laveral

Now time to play around and familiarise myself with laveral. Will write a blog post later with more of my thoughts.
