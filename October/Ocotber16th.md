Switch in focus after studying job market. PHP and laravel are in demand for jobs in my regions, so focusing on both.

- Created second droplet on DO
- SSH'd into server
- Added sudo user to server
- installed LAMP stack on virtual server
- installed laravel

Now time to play around and familiarise myself with laravel. Will write a blog post later with more of my thoughts.

Also, looking into bash scripts and will make a script to install LAMP on Linux, I have already installed LAMP stack on 3 seperate occasions and it is becoming tedious, so having a script for this makes sense and is a good skill to have.
