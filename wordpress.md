# Wordpress

Early on in my programming journey I managed to negotiate myself a freelance role at a small web development agency, which is great for a few reasons, first I get to learn the business side of things, second I get to gain exposure to remote working, which is something of high interest to me and finally it allows me to learn one of the most widely used platforms on the web.

## Drag & Drop

Now I should state that not everything is programming here, some of the work this agency takes on use very simple themes that are basically just designing the layout by dragging and dropping different modules and then populating the site.

## Child Themes

One thing I have become accustomed to is using a child sheet and custom CSS to add extra features to the site.
