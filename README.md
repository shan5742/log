# log
An active log of my learning. My current plan is to learn vanilla JS followed by React and then move onto the backend, I will update this with a more complete roadmap in due course.

## Roadmap

Roadmap coming soon...

## Structure

This log will have a seperate update each day (assuming I get some studying in) barring the first post as I wanted a little more content ot get this started and catch up with current progress. I will then organise the repo into folders by month to keep things a little cleaner. Assuming I get as far as years :) then I will further break this down into years.
