# LAMP Stack

After extensive research into the local (and beyond) job market it is pretty clear that if I want to maxamise my chances of finding a junior position I need to familiarise myself with WordPress, PHP and in particular Laravel, so I am going ot be spending a lot of time on them going forward.

### WordPress

I feel I am getting enough exposure to the WordPress CMS from my freelance work, so in my spare time, which is now my learning time I will be focusing on PHP and Laravel.

I did however install WordPress on a VPS just to give me more experience with installing the LAMP stack and basic Linux commands.

### Working with LAMP

I have now done this many times, but I will briefly explain the process I take in getting a VPS setup with the LAMP stack.

- Create droplet on DO
- SSH into the server
- Add sudo user to server
- installed LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) on VPS

From here I have my own playground and up until now I have installed a simple WordPress blog on the VPS and also installed Laravel. I am now looking to familiarise myself with the framework and build out some simple projects, which I will link here when completed.
