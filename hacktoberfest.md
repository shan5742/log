# Hacktoberfest

With October upon us it is time for the annual Digital Ocean **HacktoberFest** which is all about getting involved in the open source world and for me personally about improving my skills with version control.

### Easy!!

Well, I managed to complete my five pull requests ine **ONE** day, which I am pretty proud of and I now get to claim that free swag üëç

I must admit that I played it pretty safe and didn't take anything complex, but I have now  become very familiar with the basics of version control and the following commands are now second nature:

- git pull
- git status
- git push
- git add .
- git commit
- git branch
- git checkout

and more!
