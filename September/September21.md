# September 21st

Today I started getting back into JavaScript challenges, I was growing a little tired of Edabit as a lot of their challenges were very similar, I was recently recommended [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io), which looks super cool.

I didn't have a ton of time today, so I just got everything installed and setup ready to go.

I'll hopefully start working on this a few times a week now. One of the cool things about exercism is that they have a bunch of mentors helping out with your progress, so you will get feedback on your challenges, which is awesome considering this is all completely free.

### Interview prep 2.0

Aside from this I have done some more interview prep, I don't have a date yet, but I assume my interview will be next week. I now have a good idea of some good questions to ask, have well thought out answers to some of the things I expect to come up and have some other strategies in place for things I don't know.
