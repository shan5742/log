# September 9

Today I decided to revisit React, I have been excited to use React since beginning my journey in programming, but have kept putting it off to have a better understanding of JS which is good in theory, but I think I may have taken it too far now.

I went back through ZTM React app, finalised everything and deployed it using Netlify, which was awesome!

I also did a lot of thinking about what I want to be doing in the next few weeks. A blog post will be coming showing it in more detail.
