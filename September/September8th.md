# September 8

Back after a week off and working on more JS challenges. Finally feel like I am getting somewhere with vanilla JS now.

Looking back at JS30 course from Wes Bos to ensure full understanding of basic JS - what each app does and how it does it.

**GIT** Mastering Git is something I have identified as essential, so working with it regularly is something that I want to do. I'm making commits daily, using good commit messages and exposing myself to merges, branches, pull requests and more. I now feel very comfortable with the basics of Git on the command line.

React is now very much on my agenda, starting going through the docs and checking out various different resources as well as going back over my RoboFriends app. Hopefully will start working on my next React app soon.
