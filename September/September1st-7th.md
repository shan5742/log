# September

The first week of September has started with a lot of family time and other things getting in my way of my regular study path, but it has certainly not been wasted in terms of learning like I initially thought.

A little self reflection and blogging has made me see that these 'breaks' are actually very useful. Here are some of the things I have been working on without even realising it:

- **Problem Solving** - barely a day has went by where I have not thought about some problem from a programming perspective, which means my problem solving skills were getting a workout without me realising.
- **Networking** - I have spent a lot of my 'break' chatting to other developers on Twitter, Discord and LinkedIn, which will for sure benefit me at some point in my career.
- **General Knowledge** - Whenever I'm not in front of the computer programming I am often thinking about a future blog post, reading articles on medium, scoping out product hunt for ideas etc.

I hope you can see from the small list above that once we start programming we don't really take breaks anymore, so don't beat yourself up when you have a week without a commit, just pick up where you left off and things will figure themselves out.
