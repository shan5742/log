Gatsby is something that has really interested me lately, I have wanted a new personal site for a while to act as a portfolio and I also wanted to move my blog away from Jekyll.

So after reading through some documentation and looking at some Gatsby Starters I decided to make both and deployed them via Netlify.

I'm pretty happy with the end result, see below:

## JavaScript

I have also been re-watching some of the advanced JavaScript videos from ZTM on Udemy just as a refresher, focusing on array methods.
