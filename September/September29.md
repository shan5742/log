# September 29th

- Started working through Eloquent JavaScript and have opened a GitHub repo for it, so that I can take notes as well as work through the exercise.

- More interview prep and company research, starting to feel more at ease with everything now

- Installed various atom extensions and packages to improve workflow

- **Networking** - I have been doing lots of networking with people new and old, I am a firm beliver in ones network being the most important aspect of job hunting, so I try to take regular time to keep up to date with my contacts and make new ones.
