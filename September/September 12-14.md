# September 12th through 14th

It's been a stressful and exciting few days. I applied for a job recently and have received an online test to do, so pretty much everything has been on hold while I get that sorted. I've learnt a bunch though and feel much more confident with the basics on React.

### React

My job was to create a dynamic and responsive web page that retrieves data from an API and displays it in various different ways. I could use anything I wanted to build it, so I opted for React. I have created all my components and have the page looking how I want it to (more or less), visually.

### Next Steps

Next I need to get on with the API stuff, which is a little tricky to me right now as I don't have much experience with it at the moment, but after chatting with a few people who have been great I feel a lot more confident.
