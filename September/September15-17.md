# September 15 - 17

In the past week I have been working on a test sent to me from a potential employer, the app is in React and involves calling for data from API that was given to me.

I have learnt a ton from this exercise and ended up with what I would like to think of as a good final page. See below:

I have just submitted and now eagerly await the response. I'm obviously hoping this results in a job or at least further interviews, but even if it doesn't I have learnt a lot fom the process and am happy that I did it.

I'll be getting back to my regular path now of coding challenges, working through ZTM and exploring the likes of Gatsby, Bulma and Tachyons.
