# August 2018

### FreeCodeCamp 

I started my journey into webdevelopment at FreeCodeCamp where I completed the first certificate in responsive front end. This gave me a great overview of html, CSS and some very basic JavaScript and has been the foundation to my learning.

### JavaScript

I decided I wanted to get a solid understanding of vanilla JavaScript, so I started a course ZTM on Udemy which has been great for getting the basics. To expand on that I started following some YouTube channels, such as fun fun function and more. I am now trying to practice daily challenges on the likes of Codewars and Edabit, which is proving difficult but helpful.

### Git

Throughout August I have been learning Git, making regular commits to various projects, namely my blog, which is tracking my progress mixed in with different webdev musings. I started with GitHub desktop on a windows system, but upgraded my laptop and decided to run Linux only, so I could get used to the command line. Since doing so I am very comfortable with the basic Git commands such as:

- git status
- git add .
- git commit
- git push
- git pull
- git branch
- git pull
- git checkout
- git init

I have also contributed to some open source projects in the ZTM open source playground. ZTM is the course I am using to learn the basics of web development on Udemy.
