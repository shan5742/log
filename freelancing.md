# Freelancing

I have managed to get taken on by a small agency creating custom wordpress sites, it is fairly simple stuff in terms of development, nothing more than custom css and manipulating themes, but it is genuine commercial experience, working with a team and dealing with clients which is great.

### Design

The majority of the freelance work I have done so far is layouts, simply organising and wireframing various ecommerce sites, so simple things such as home, about, contact and shop pages.

### Custom CSS with Divi Theme

The agency I am working for is using a custom Divi theme, so the main scope for being creative is with custom CSS, I have found some cool resources and have been playing around with various things like animations, hover effects and auto-scrolling carousels.

### Time Management and Invoicing

Some of the not so obvious skills that come from freelancing have been learning to manage my time, which is essential if I want future flexible working hours and possible full remote positions.

Furthermore dealing with invoicing has been great and leaves freelancing as a viable career choice now.
