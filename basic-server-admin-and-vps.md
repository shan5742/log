# Basic Linux Admin

One of my goals is to become a command line power user, ever since finding Linux way back when I have been obsessed with the command line, custom terminal setup and more and I figured the next logical stage is to learn some basic linux server admin and dip my toe into the world of VPS

### Digital Ocean

I decided (after getting an awesome referral deal from my mentor) to use **Digital Ocean** to create my VPS *droplets* and it was super simple to setup after following the very easy to read documentation from DO.

After an hour or so I had created and destroyed multiple droplets as well as securing them and playing around with SSH keys.

This got me comfortable working on the command line and I can now easily install and configure a development environment within the VPS.

### Next Steps

The next steps are to look into installing the **LAMP** stack and then maybe installing the likes of *WordPress* and *Laravel*
