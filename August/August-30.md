# Aygust 30

today ive worked more on design for a client site, creating logos and image manipulation.

ive completed a number of JavaScript challenges that i have put in my codingchallenges repo

finally ive created a new repo, which is a personal site that im using to play around with some css. Im looking to create a new portfolio but im not completely sold on an idea yet.
