### design

I have spent the majority of the day (6 hours) working on a website for a client. The brief was to create a sleek, modern and responsive website for a sports memorabilia company who have close to zero online presence. Today I was working on the design side of things which isn't really my cup of tea, but it was a good thing. Learning to use GULP to add effects, create banner images and manipulate images is a great skill to add to my arsenal. I'm happy to step out of my comfort zone and level up my skillset in these areas.

### JavaScript

I have also spent a few hours working on JavaScript challenges, which have been updated in my [coding challenges repo](https://github.com/shan5742/codingchallenges). This is something I am hoping to day daily or close to it as I have identified upping my JavaScript game my number one priority right now.

### Community Engagement

A new goal of mine is to start helping others, I am a member of various Discord groups as well as running my own beginners channel. I take time each day to answer queries and help others where I can across these platforms. Today I spent approx 30mins doing so.

### Videos

I have watched 2x videos in the functional programming series on YouTube, the channel for these videos is [fun fun function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) which I have found to be a great resource in my JavaScript learning.
