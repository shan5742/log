# Automation and Scripting

Automation has been something that has interested me for a while now, more so since working with Droplets on DO.

I have now installed many different VPS's and each time have installed the LAMP stack before working on any projects, this is not a difficult process but it is pretty tedious and I thought it would be fun to work towards building a script to do it for me.

This is not something I am capable of right now, but something that I think is a viable goal. I decided to create a scripts repo to store everything I'm doing, hopefully longer term it can have a set of useful scripts to automate things such as github commits, creating new project folders and more. 

Repo is [here](https://github.com/shan5742/scripts)

**UPDATE** *I have now created my first couple of scripts and I am really enjoying this type of work, this will definitely be an ongoing project*
